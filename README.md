## Overview

This repository contains supplementary materials, documentation, and resources for the review paper "Beyond digital twins: the role of foundation models in enhancing the interpretability of multiomics modalities in precision medicine" published in FEBS Open Bio.

## Abstract

Medical digital twins (MDTs) are virtual representations of patients that simulate the biological, physiological, and clinical processes of individuals to support personalized healthcare. However, interpreting complex datasets from biomedical modalities, such as multiomics, medical imaging, and electronic records, presents significant challenges, particularly in terms of interoperability and producing accurate simulations. This review discusses the integration of Foundation Models (FMs) into MDT systems, particularly their role in enhancing the interpretability of multiomics data. We examine current challenges, recent advancements, and future opportunities in leveraging FMs for multiomics analysis in MDTs, with a focus on their application in precision medicine.
